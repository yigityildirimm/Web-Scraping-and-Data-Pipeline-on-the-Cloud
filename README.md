# Web Scraping and Data Pipeline on the Cloud

## Project Description 
(Case Study)
This project is aimed at solving the data needs of \"Gans,\" a startup developing an e-scooter-sharing
system operating in major cities worldwide. The primary objective is to
collect, process, and provide real-time data from various external
sources to help Gans predict e-scooter movement and ensure that their
scooters are available where users need them.

As the Data Engineer for Gans, my role includes assembling and
automating a data pipeline in the cloud to collect and store the
following types of data:

- Demographical Data\: Collected from Wikipedia using web
scraping techniques. 
- Weather Data\: Obtained through APIs to
track weather conditions in different cities.
 - Airport and Flights Data\: Also collected through APIs to monitor airport activities and
flight schedules.

All collected data will be stored in a SQL database and regularly
updated. The data pipeline will be hosted on AWS for seamless data
collection and accessibility.
